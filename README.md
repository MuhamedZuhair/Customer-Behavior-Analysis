# Marketing Impact on Customer Behavior in Banking

## Project Description
This project analyzes the impact of marketing strategies on customer behavior in the banking sector using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Various models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, were implemented to predict customer responses and provide actionable insights for optimizing marketing efforts.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Optimization Techniques:** Adam optimizer, Dropout, BatchNormalization, EarlyStopping

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project, `bank_merged.csv`, includes various features such as:
- Customer demographic information
- Previous marketing campaign interactions
- Customer responses to banking offers

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Import & Exploration:**
   - Load and inspect the dataset
   - Handle missing values and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Convert categorical variables
   - Split the data into training and testing sets

3. **Model Training:**
   - Train and evaluate ML models
   - Assess performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

4. **Deep Learning Model Development:**
   - Build a neural network using Keras
   - Apply optimization techniques to enhance performance

5. **Model Evaluation:**
